# Semantic_Segmentation_with_UNET
# Data
Data loaded from [2018 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data). In my case, I used stage1_train.zip which contains training set images(images and annotated masks) and stage1_test.zip  which contains test set images. preproccecing.py will create X_train, Y_train, X_test tht used to train model.
# UNET
[UNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) - Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation. The goal of semantic image segmentation is to label each pixel of an image with a corresponding class of what is being represented.
