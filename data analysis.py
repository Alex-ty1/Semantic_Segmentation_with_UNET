# Dataset consists of pictures (a large number of segmented nuclei images).
# Within this folder are two subfolders:
# -images contains the image file
# -masks contains the segmented masks of each nucleus. This folder is only included in the training set.
#  Each mask contains one nucleus. Masks are not allowed to overlap (no pixel belongs to two masks)
# Ð¡onvert each image of the nucleus into one image so that each image of the nucleus is compared with one mask.
